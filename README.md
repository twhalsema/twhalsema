## Welcome
Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I have prepared a portfolio repository as a way to showcase my skillset which can be found here: https://github.com/twhalsema/portfolio

At the time of writing (July 2024), I am currently looking for a new job. I have been an Oracle DBA for over 12 years, and I am ready to try something new. Over the last several months, I have been learning skills aligned with the following positions:

- Site Reliability Engineer
- DevOps Engineer
- Infrastructure Engineer

I encourage anyone considering me for employment to look over my portfolio linked above to make a more informed hiring decision.
