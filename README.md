# Thomas Halsema
## Welcome
Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.
At the time of writing (July 2024), I am currently looking for a new job. I have been an Oracle DBA for over 12 years, and I am ready to try something new. Over the last several months, I have been learning skills aligned with the following positions:

- Site Reliability Engineer
- DevOps Engineer
- Infrastructure Engineer

## Professional Portfolio
### Overview
I encourage anyone considering me for employment to look over the portfolio of work I have prepared.
It currently consists of this repository: https://github.com/twhalsema/walman

The <b>walman</b> repo consists of 3 parts:
1. <b>Walman</b> (short for Wallet Manager) - A Python program which allows the user to declaratively define Oracle wallets (database credential stores), populate them with credentials from 1password.com, and deploy the wallets to remove database client servers. (This allows centralized management of DB connection info for services to allow for easier password rotation.)
2. Ansible and other automation files to create a test environment to demo <b>Walman</b>. These are found in the <b>examples</b> directory.
3. Documentation for <b>Walman</b> and the test environment setup. This is intended both for anyone to better understand Walman as well as to highlight my technical writing ability.

### Skills Demonstrated
The following skills are demonstrated in my portfolio.
Please note that I have not used AI in the creation of any of the files found in my portfolio.
